# Stash Manager - TFG
Stash Manager is an everyday application designed to facilitate the localization of items within the home. This idea arises from the common need to find objects whose exact location we do not know, for example, identifying whether the PlayStation 2 bought years ago is stored in the storage room or the junk closet. The application allows the user to register their items in advance, so they can locate them quickly and efficiently.

The main objective of Stash Manager is to improve home organization, allowing users to save time when searching for stored objects. The application is designed for users to register and locate items not only in the storage room but also in drawers, refrigerators, closets, and other storage spaces.

Initially conceived to manage the contents of the storage room, Stash Manager has been expanded to encompass various storage spaces in the home, thus providing a comprehensive solution for organizing and quickly accessing stored items.
